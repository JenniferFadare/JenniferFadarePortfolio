## Acceptance Criteria for this assignment:

GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work

- [x] WHEN I load their portfolio THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
  - By far, the easiet thing to do was talk about myself.
  - I used my work for the run-buddy site and the herieon site as my references.
  - I asked friends to give me ideas for website mockups for future projects.

- [x] WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
  - This part was easy. I referenced run-buddy to help with this.
  - The mock up had a "Resume" link in the navigation bar.  Mine doesn't work because I don't have a resume completed yet.
 
- [x] WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
  - There's not much content so it won't be as dramatic of a scroll as the run-buddy site was.  Maybe if I spoke about myself more....

- [x] WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
  - I think I have this one down, but think the intent of this one was to make the application grow in size when its hovered over and not just make the first one     bigger

- [x] WHEN I click on the images of the applications THEN I am taken to that deployed application
  - I had a difficult time with this one because I wanted the user to be able to click anywhere in .box1 to get to the link
  - If I had more time to research javascript before this project I would've finished it

- [x] WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport
  - I was able to complete this entirely by using @media screen and (max-width: 980px) as my breakpoint.  
  - I left the other media query breakpoints for 768px and 575px as place holders as I go back and update my site.

## Thought Process for designing this website

I wanted this website to reflect my work.  Even though I have basic knowledge of how to design and make a website from scratch, I'm extremely happy with how this turned out.

I *love* flamingos! The funnest part of this project was trying to find pictures of flamingos to put on the banners and place holders (maybe took too long for that part).

I didn't pay any attention to spotify before this assignment but it's now one of my favorite sites to go to when I start coding. Thanks UT Austin!

The part I dreaded was doing the photo gallery for my work.  I kept the transitions simple because I didn't want to break the site or spend too long on it, but I feel better about my ability to apply and understand flexboxes and grids.

One part that needs to be improved is the UI that allows navigation to the work if the user clicks anywhere in the container boxes.  I think this will be easy to do with javascript when I learn it.

Not inclcuded in this assignment as a requirement, but something I thought was important, is a footer that shows the last time the site was updated so that others can see that I actively work and update my personal site.

The other thing that is on my list of things to do is to finish my resume so I can link it to the site, then give the user the ability to print it out.

Either case, I'm happy to be some what done with this.

Although I turned this assignment late, I didn't reference the solution posted in the class repository or anyone elses code.
